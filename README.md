# 📝 Blogr - Frontendmentor.io Challenge 📝

I have challenged myself to create few websites based on challenges from frontendmentor.io. This is fully responsive website based on Blogr template challenge.

For this project I have used Tailwind CSS framework to create fully responsive layout.

Note: This website has fully compiled CSS file.

🖥️ Fully working website can be accessed here: https://blogr-frontendmentor-rm.netlify.app/
